# Access-Policy-Engine üèõÔ∏è

A foundational, open-source engine that enables automated accessibility compliance testing against declarative policies. This project is proposed for funding by the **Sovereign Tech Fund (STF)**.

## The Problem: The Missing Link in Accessibility Compliance

The digital economy faces a critical challenge: ensuring compliance with a growing number of accessibility regulations like the European Accessibility Act (EAA) or Section 508 in the US. Existing open-source tools are excellent at identifying technical violations (e.g., WCAG errors), but a crucial infrastructure layer is missing: a way to flexibly translate these technical issues into compliance with specific, defined policies. This creates a significant, unfunded gap, leaving projects vulnerable and developers without clear, actionable guidance.

## The Solution: A Foundational Engine for Policy-Based Compliance

**Access-Policy-Engine** provides this missing link. It's not just another scanner; it's a universal, foundational engine that separates the *scanning logic* from the *compliance logic*. This provides two key public goods:

1.  **A Universal, Reusable Engine:** The core engine is a policy-agnostic library that can be integrated into any testing workflow.
2.  **Declarative, Shareable Policies:** Any organization can define its accessibility requirements (legal, corporate, etc.) as a simple, human-readable configuration file.

Our first, reference implementation will be a complete policy module for the **European Accessibility Act (EAA)**, providing immediate and critical value to the European ecosystem.

## How It Works

The engine uses a simple, powerful methodology:
- **Standard Scanners:** It leverages the power of existing, trusted scanning engines like `axe-core`.
- **Declarative Policy Files:** A user provides a simple YAML file defining the set of WCAG rules that constitute their "policy."
- **Context-Aware Reporting:** The engine consumes the raw scan results and filters them through the provided policy file, generating a report that answers the question: "Am I compliant with *this specific policy*?"

## üö¶ Project Status

This project is currently in the **proposal stage** for the **Sovereign Tech Fund**. The technical architecture and a 7-month roadmap have been defined.

## üî¨ Proof of Concept

To validate the core architectural approach, an initial Proof of Concept (PoC) has been developed. It demonstrates that a core engine can successfully load an external policy file and use it to filter accessibility scan results. The next stage is to develop this PoC into a production-ready, foundational piece of software.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

The proposed 7-month project is divided into three phases:

- **Phase 1: Core Engine Development.** Build the stable, well-tested, and policy-agnostic core engine in Java/Kotlin.
- **Phase 2: EAA Policy Module & Universality PoC.** Create the complete, reference policy module for the EAA and provide a technical PoC demonstrating the engine's ability to handle other policies (e.g., Section 508).
- **Phase 3: Community Starter-Pack & Documentation.** Deliver comprehensive documentation, tutorials, and contribution guides to ensure easy adoption and lay the groundwork for a community.
